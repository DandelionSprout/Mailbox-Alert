Review issues:
4) 4. When I press "test these settings" in Mailbox Alert Alert Configuration at first I got:

[XX] error at undefined:600: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH) [nsILocalFile.leafName]"  nsresult: "0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://mailboxalert/content/mailboxalert_funcs.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 600"  data: no]

This went away though.

5) accesskeys should really be localized as well as names.
